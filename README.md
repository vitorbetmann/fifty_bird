**Disclaimers:**

• A Flappy Bird Clone made for learning

• Made in C with Raylib.

• Assets from CS50's Introduction to Game Development.

<br/>

**Highlights:**

1. Designed a state machine architecture using function pointers to maintain modular, readable, and scalable code.

2. Built a custom queue to manage pipes with a O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations.

3. Applied tracked iteration optimization so the Bird only checks collision with the next pipe, reducing per-frame computation.

**Learning outcomes:**

• C: Function Pointers; More about memory management;

• Game Dev: More on State Machines.
